# NAME

Turpin bot

# SYNOPSIS

This is a crude IRC bot to replicate the online behaviour of 
dick_turpin of #tdtrs fame.

It's written in bash because it was the simplest way to do a quick hack, and 
Pete is quick and dirty.

The proclamations may be extended by adding more lines to the array, but 
beware the whitespace sensitivity! (Shout out to Python lovers)

# USAGE

Hack the settings at the top
Run it

# BUGS
